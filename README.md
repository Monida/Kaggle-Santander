# Kaggle-Santander
This repository contains the code, data and models developed for a Kaggle Competition that consists of a binary classification problem. The competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction). At first sight it is an easy binary classification model, but the unbalanced data (90:1) generates some challenges. 

The repository has 4 folders described below:

 - Scripts: has 2 scripts for drafting (model_drafts, understanding_data), the script with the final pipeline to solve the problem(final_pipeline), some functions for speeding up drafting and modeling (submission_format)

- Data folder: Has the preprocessed data as well as the data in the submission format.
  
- Models: has all the models that were created following different approaches.
  
- Notebooks: Cointains the jupyther notebooks used for drafting the models.
